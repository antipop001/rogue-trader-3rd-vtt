# Pre-implementation cross-model review — the STANDARD gate for a fix Claude has BUILT but not yet
# committed or deployed. Antigravity/Gemini independently reviews the working-tree diff against the
# cited canon and returns APPROVE / REVISE, catching plausible-but-wrong changes the author's own
# model would rubber-stamp. It reviews ONLY — it never edits, commits, or deploys.
#
# Standard workflow:
#   1. Build the fix (edit the code; do NOT commit).
#   2. Write .agy-check/context.md — the bug, the intended behaviour, and the CANON citation
#      (RT 1e rule + RT-DOCS file:line or a verbatim quote). Or pass a path as $1.
#   3. tools/agy_check/agy_check.sh
#   4. Read .agy-check/verdict.md. On REVISE: address it and re-run. Only implement (commit/deploy)
#      once the verdict is APPROVE (or you have a documented reason to override a specific point).
#
# Env: CHECK_MODEL (default "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)").
